* MapTop:
  - replace mapName by instance of Map class

* Commands:
  - !maptop:
    * group maptop by playerName to avoid same name multiple times in maptop or show player id in brackets if name appears multiple times

* onPlayerSendMap:
  - add map to random maprot


vagrant:

  - auto adjust maprot
  - auto delete default maps
  - auto add servertestgema
  - ErrorOutput class?

General:

  - Add graphic of database structure to README
  - Combine README.md files of old gema mod version and new one


Stuff to maybe do:

  - Alternative way to use options: "!command --argument value"  ?
  - Export strings to cfg file in config/string/strings-en.cfg .. strings-de.cfg
  - Unit Tests
  - Make gema mode toggable? (not base version)


Server related config files:

forbidden.cfg
maprot.cfg
motd_en.txt
nicknameblacklist.cfg
serverblacklist.cfg
servercmdline.txt
serverinfo_en.txt
serverkillmessages.cfg
serverpwd.cfg



--------------

Not Base version:


* !gtop and !maptop stuff = records group
* make !maptop <weapon> <startRank>

* add !gtop | !gemaTop
  => List of points per player
  => Each rank 1 is worth 10 points
  => Each other rank is worth 1 point
  => !gtop <weapon> <startRank>  => Shows the gtop

  -> add grank
	=> !grank  => show own grank	
	=> !grank <player> => show grank of a player
  -> add mrank
	=> !mrank => show own mrank
	=> !mrank <player> => show mrank of a player
  -> add uploader to map in db
  -> add timestamp to record in db
  -> add weapon system
  -> add everything from previous mod

  -> !ignore  !unignore  !ignorelist  !ignoreall  !unignoreall
  -> !pm  !colorSay  !setColor
  -> !mapinfo
	=> Upload Date
	=> Uploader
	=> Finished by x players
	=> Finished with x weapons

  -> !whois <cn>  => show geoip and country

onScore:

  - Show time difference to above rank and rank 1?

* Output:

  - Add possibility to print with ignore list

* DataBase:

  - Allow connection to external db server with a server attribute



possible other classes:

  - ColorSelector
	=> getColor() -> switch case + check whether color is valid
	=> constants?


Easy gtop:

  "SELECT * FROM (
     SELECT * FROM records
     ORDER BY time, map
  )"

- Get all records
- Order by time and map
- Set ranks in sql query where map is equal, then restart at 1
- group by record.player (or player_name?) -> sum of (Amount Rank 1 * 10) + Amount other ranks
- output: The 5 best players on this server are:
  1) name with 9989 points\t(records 1889, best times 900)
- maybe save amount best times and amount records in player table


- Lua ORM

- Add colors to player say text "name[ip]: text"
- Add a privacy reminder? => non existant privacy in this game..


Website for gema records:

  * web interface for maptop of lua server
    -> list maps where a specific player has records

  * make a website like tasvideos.org for assaultcube gema videos containg demo files of best records
    => Accept demo files from other servers


Hint: Used Lua Development Tools to edit the lua files.
